-Take notes in keeperapp and all the notes are stored locally in the browser.
-App stores all the notes in the browser and not in the database.
-Refresh the page and all the notes will be removed.
-So, let the keeperapp keep notes for you...
-Notes have a note title and a note description.
-Created notes can be deleted.

    -Add note title and then add note description.
